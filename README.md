# work-day-scheduler

This application is a single work day scheduler. You will see
the current date displayed. There are 9 business hour blocks that
can be filled in. When you save an entry, it will save to local storage where it will still be displayed if the page is refreshed. The hour blocks will change color to denote if it is the present hour, past hour or a future hour. If you want to delete an item, remove it and resave an empty block.
